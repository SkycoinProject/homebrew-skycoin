Homebrew formulae for installing Skycoin projects and dependencies on OS X.

# Usage

Use the following commands to Tap the Homebrew repository

```sh
brew tap SkycoinProject/homebrew-skycoin
```

Then install any of [available Formulae](https://github.com/SkycoinProject/homebrew-skycoin/tree/master/Formula).
For instance execute this to install Skycoin CX to your system.

```sh
brew install skycoin-cx
```

# Testing changes
The following process can be used to test changes made to formula:
1. Ensure the target formula has already been installed on your system. I will use `skycoin-cx` to demonstrate.
2. Fork this repo on Github and clone it locally to your machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes.
4. Make your changes to the target formula and commit them.
5. Change directory into the skycoin-cx Homebrew
```sh
cd $(brew --repo SkycoinProject/homebrew-skycoin)/Formula
```
6. Unlink the currently installed version of the formula with the following command:
```sh
brew unlink skycoin-cx
```
6. Copy your updated formula into the `SkycoinProject/homebrew-skycoin/Formula` folder - replacing the exiting version
7. Test download of the new package from the Formula URL
```sh
brew fetch skycoin-cx
```
8. Test the installation using the new Formula (with verbose mode and based on the locally updated file)
```sh
brew install -vsd --git skycoin-cx
```

All going well, you should have just installed the updated version based on the new formula. If that is the case, submit a PR with your changes to the team for further review. If you encounter issue, repeat the process above until you are able to successfully install the based on the udpated version.
